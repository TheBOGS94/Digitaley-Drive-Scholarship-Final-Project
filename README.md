#### Interventions Specific to Departments: -Pay attention to departments that have lower average satisfaction ratings.
-Hold focused focus groups to better understand and address particular issues.

#### Role-Specific Support and Training: -Offer extra help and training, especially for staff roles that have lower satisfaction ratings.
Make that managers and supervisors receive training on identifying and meeting the needs of their team members.

### Results
-Most workers are aware of their obligations and positions in the company, so they know what is expected of them.
Work satisfaction is a problem that needs to be addressed with specific solutions.
- Workplace Friendships: There was more variation and disagreement when asked if one had a best friend at work. This might be resolved by developing chances for team building and enhancing workplace culture.
-Training Opportunities: Employee responses showed that they are interested in learning new skills. Improving training and development opportunities for professionals may boost jobÂ satisfaction.

### Recommendation

### Conclusion

Employers can improve on the employee's satisfaction by addressing the disagreed responses on the survey questions. This will help increase the productivity of the work.
